# Advanced DCGAN
An in-depth look at DCGANs, the motivation behind them, and a highly detailed overview of the optimization techniques and tricks necessary to stabailize training between a Generator/Discriminator pair.

[See Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IliaZenkov/Advanced-DCGAN/blob/main/DCGAN_Final.ipynb)

I build a GAN trained on and capable of generating CelebA in original aspect ratio (CelebA aligned: 218x178; 5:4)
